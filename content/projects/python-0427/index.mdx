Pythons are randomly generated programmatically through Python code.

Minting of this slithering syntax will be capped at 2,000.

The code script rolls to generate 1 of 4 different types of 'Pythons'. Garters are most common, Mambas are most rare. Tier List as follows: Mamba>Cobra>Rattler>Garter.

Each 'Python' then rolls for a chance to receive a rare attribute, and could potentially receive all 3...most likely none at all. Rare Attributes are as follows: Hypnotize; Snake Skin; Fangs.

Who am I? Just a regular guy (accountant) with a wife and kid (and one on the way) who wrote the code to bring these Pythons to life.

I've shared my code here for you all to enjoy: https://github.com/PythonsNFT/Pythons-NFT-Script/tree/main

UPDATE: Project cap has been reduced to 1800

Minting = Complete

ON 4/2/21 @ 11AM EST - THE REMAINING COLLECTION (1,400 PYTHONS) WAS RELEASED FOR FREE
